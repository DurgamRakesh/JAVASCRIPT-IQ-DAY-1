    <h1>JAVASCRIPT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS PREPARATION DAY-1</h1>
    <p>1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</p>
    <pre>
        IN JS,Both are comparision operators and they are return boolean values only.
        The difference between  both that is '==' operator is used to compare the values where as '===' operator is used to compare both value and datatype.

        EX:
        var a = 100;
        var b = '100';

        console.log(a==b)--->return true because it checks values not datatype.
        -it will do type coresion to change the datatype so that value can be campared

        console.log(a===b)--->return false because it checks value and datatype.
        -values are same but a is number type and b is string type.

        -so strict equal (===) operator both value and datatype should be same (a=100,b=100) otherwise return false.


    </pre>
    <p>2.What is the spread operator?</p>
    <pre>
        IN JS,javascript spread operator(...) allow us to destructure the non-primitive datatypes like arrays,objects to access the each element individully.
        -The spread operator denoted by three dots(...)
        -It was introduced in ES6
        
        EX:
        const array1 = [100,200,300,400,500];

        console.log(...array1);

        Output: 100 200 300 400 500  -> it is called destructure 


    </pre>
    <p>3.What are the differences between var, let and const?</p>
    <pre>
        var is a global scoped means ,variable created with var keyword will be access globally.
        it can redeclared and reinitiazed.
        -It is avaible from beginning when the javascript was introduced
        EX: var num = 100;

        let is a block scoped means ,variable created with let keyword will be access only in that specific block.
        it cannot redeclared but it can be reinitiazed.
        -It was introduced in ES6.
        EX: let num = 100;

        const is also block scoped means ,variable created with const keyword will be access only in that specific block.
        it cannot redeclared and cannot be reinitiazed.
        -It is also introduced in ES6.
        EX: const num = 100;

    </pre>
    <p>4.What is execution context?</p>
    <pre>
       IN JS, javascript engine is uses a call stacks and also created special environment to handle the execution of js code.
       this environment is called as execution context.
       -Execution content contains code that's currently running ,and everything that aids in its execution.
       -In execution content two phases are there 
           -Global execution content.
           -Function execution content.

    </pre>
    <p>5.What is meant by first class functions?</p>
    <pre>
       In JS , A programming language is said to have first-class function when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

       -In such a language function can be passed as a argument to another function,and can be return by another function,
       and can be assigned as a value to variable.

       EX:
       Passing as argument:-

       function myfun1(){
        return 'Hello welcome to';
       }

       function myfun2(callback,msg){
        console.log(callback(),msg)
       }

       myfun2(myfun1,'javascript');

       Output: Hello welcome to javascript

       return a function:-

       function myfun1(){
        return () => {
            console.log('Hello welcome to javascript');
        }
       }
       myfun1();

       Output: Hello welcome to javascript

       assigned a function to a variable:-

       const myfun = () => {
        console.log('Hello welcome to javascript');
       }
       myfun();

       Output: Hello welcome to javascript
    </pre>
    <p>6.What are closures? Give an example of closure?</p>
    <pre>
       In JS ,closure is the combination of a function bundled together with reference to its nearest state (the lexical environment).
       -In simple words access the outer function from an inner function.

       EX:
       function outside(){
        var num = 500;
        function inside(){
            console.log(num);
        }
        return inside;
       }
       outside();

       Output: 500
    </pre>
    <p>7.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()?</p>
    <pre>
       In JS ,
       call() method calls the function with a given this value and arguments provided individually.

       EX:
       const details = {
        fullName: function(city, country) {
          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + "," + city + "," + country;
        }
      }
      const student = {
        firstName:"abc",
        lastName: "xyz"
      }
      details.fullName.call(student, "hyd", "india");

      apply() method calls the specified function with a given this value, and arguments provided as an array.

      EX:
       const details = {
        fullName: function(city, country) {
          return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + "," + city + "," + country;
        }
      }
      const student = {
        firstName:"abc",
        lastName: "xyz"
      }
      details.fullName.call(student,["hyd", "india"]);

      bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value,
       with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

      EX:
      const student = {
      firstName:"abc",
      lastName: "xyz",
      fullname: function () {
        console.log(this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;);
      }
    }
    
    let fullname = student.fullname.bind(student);
    setTimeout(fullName, 3000);
